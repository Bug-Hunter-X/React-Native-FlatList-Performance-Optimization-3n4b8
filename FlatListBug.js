This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset. The performance becomes very slow and the app may freeze or crash. This is because the FlatList component renders all items at once, even those not visible on the screen. This can be fixed by using the `windowSize` and `maxToRenderPerBatch` props to control the number of items rendered at once.
